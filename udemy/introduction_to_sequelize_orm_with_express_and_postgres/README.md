# Introduction to sequelize orm with express and postgres

# About this course

- If you have worked with relational databases, then I want to introduce you to them.

- In a Job, you are most likely to work with a ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to handle things like queries, insertions, etc.

- If you have worked with relational databases and worked with an ORM like ActiveRecord for Ruby, then this is to show how Sequelize can be.

- I want to show you a pattern I use for my projects.

- Especially, I want to show you how may pattern allows for easy testing.

- This brings us to the next point

- I want to show you how to test a Node.js app with Jest and supertest!

- "Untested coede is broken code".

# What we are going to build ?

```
# What we are going to learn ?

JWT (aren't the focus)
Sequelize
Testing
Express.js
Docker
Best practices!
```
